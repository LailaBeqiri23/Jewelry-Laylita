          Italian jeweler LAYLITA creates unique pieces that unlock the natural
          forces embedded in the precious materials he uses. In his hands, gold
          and platinum are folded, forced and twisted to create a tension that
          evokes the inherent rhythm of the metal.

          Diamonds are dynamic: encircled by the curving lines of each piece,
          they are part of an action that speaks of movement and growth.
          Although not directly influenced by the natural world, LAYLITA jewels
          harness the complexity of organic forms. At once ephemeral and strong,
          they invoke a powerful calm. His diamond and gold rings may remind you
          of the exposed roots of a tree winding around a rock. The simple
          elegance of his designs - soft but never silent - are intended to
          leave the door wide open to interpretation, allowing the beauty of
          storytelling to unfold in the mind of each wearer.

        <h2>~ THE ART OF MAKING ~</h2>
        <p>
          The life of a LAYLITA jewel invariably starts with a single strip of
          precious metal. In his studio in Tilburg, located in the Dutch
          province of Brabant, LAYLITA places a passionate focus on the rich
          nature of this material. Each sweeping bend, twist, and turn is the
          result of a very balanced approach, achieved through manual dexterity
          and physically forced. His pieces are patterned with ultra-fine lines,
          the result of a meticulous sanding process. LAYLITA's savoir-faire is
          rooted in his desire to reflect an inner truth, which is further
          enhanced by an absence of decoration. Once the gold has found its new
          form, there is no fuss â€“ it retains a sense of earthiness and
          authenticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diamonds are introduced when the strip of gold or platinum is being
          modeled, never after. The gems are not fixed in place by traditional
          prongs or settings. Instead, they are caught in a metallurgic dance of
          tension. They are held in place as if by magic. This rare technique is
          rooted in the belief that materiality possesses its own language,
          which ultimately reveals itself to LAYLITA through the making process
          allowing him to embolden and enrich it in its most evocative form.
